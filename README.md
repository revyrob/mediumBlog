# School Blog Site
Commuication with parents and the school can be overwhelming.  Here is a trial for my kids' school to see if this blog commuincation site decreases the burden from school administration and gives a central spot for parents to find information.  
Built with Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, and Sanity.
Sanity is an easy-to-use backend that a non-technical person can easily create posts, delete posts, edit posts, approve comments, and delete comments.
